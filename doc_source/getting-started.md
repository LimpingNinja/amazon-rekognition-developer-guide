# Getting started with Amazon Rekognition<a name="getting-started"></a>

This section provides topics to get you started using Amazon Rekognition\. If you're new to Amazon Rekognition, we recommend that you first review the concepts and terminology presented in [How Amazon Rekognition works](how-it-works.md)\. 

Before you can use Rekognition, you'll need to create an AWS account and obtain an AWS account ID\. You will also want to create an IAM user, which enables the Amazon Rekognition system to determine if you have the permissions needed to access its resources\.

After creating your accounts, you'll want to install and configure the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs\. The AWS CLI lets you interact with Amazon Rekognition and other services through the command line, while the AWS SDKs let you use programming languages like Java and Python to interact with Amazon Rekognition\. 

Once you have set up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs, you can look at some examples of how to use both of them\. You can also view some examples of how to interact with Amazon Rekognition using the console\.
